# Zerodha Trading App

Welcome to the **Zerodha Trading App** repository! This project is a stock trading platform simulation, built using **React JS** with **Vite.js** for optimized performance and **Bootstrap** for responsive design. The app is purely frontend-focused, with no external API integration, and it includes a structured implementation of **React Routing** to navigate between pages smoothly.

## Features

- **React JS Frontend**: Modern React components with state management using hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
- **Vite.js**: Fast build tool to ensure optimal performance during development and production builds.
- **React Router**: Seamless navigation between multiple pages (e.g., dashboard, portfolio, order history).
- **Bootstrap for Styling**: Responsive and clean UI design with Bootstrap 5.
- **User Dashboard**: A demo user interface to simulate trading operations (no real data fetched).
- **Portfolio Simulation**: Users can simulate stock portfolio management.
- **Order Placement Simulation**: Demo functionality to place buy/sell orders for different stocks.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

## Tech Stack

- **React JS**: Frontend library for building UI components.
- **Vite.js**: Lightning-fast build tool and dev server.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different views in the app.
- **Bootstrap**: CSS framework for responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Modern JavaScript features for building the app logic.
